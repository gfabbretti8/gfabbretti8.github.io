My research is focused on reversibility of concurrent and distributed systems, more precisely we are investigating new ways to employ reversibility as a debugging technique in the context of the Erlang programming language.


### About me

I am from Pesaro, Italy, which is a small city on the Adriatic sea. I lived there most of my life until one day I decided to move to Bologna, Italy to pursue my studies in CS. Currently, life brought me in Grenoble, France where I am doing my studies, enjoying the mountains around and getting to know a new culture and language.
