Welcome to my academic and personal page, my name is Giovanni Fabbretti and I am a Ph.D. student at INRIA under the supervision of [Ivan Lanese](http://www.cs.unibo.it/~lanese/) and [Jean-Bernard Stefani](https://team.inria.fr/spades/jean-bernard-stefani/).

My research is focused on reversibility of concurrent and distributed systems, more precisely we are investigating new ways to employ reversibility as a debugging technique in the context of the Erlang programming language.

### About me

I am from Pesaro, Italy, which is a small city on the Adriatic sea. I lived there most of my life until one day I decided to move to Bologna, Italy to pursue my studies in CS. Currently, life brought me in Grenoble, France where I am doing my studies, enjoying the mountains around and getting to know a new culture and language.
