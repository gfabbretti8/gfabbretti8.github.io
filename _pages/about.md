Welcome to my academic and personal page, my name is Giovanni Fabbretti and I am a Ph.D. student at INRIA under the supervision of Ivan Lanese and Jean-Bernard Stefani.

My thesis is about reversibility of concurrent and distributed systems, more precisely we are studying it in the context of the Erlang programming language. 

I am from Pesaro, Italy which is a small city on the Adriatic sea. I lived there most of my life until one day I decided to move to Bologna, Italy to pursue my studies in CS. Currently life brought me in Grenoble, France where I am currently doing my studies and enjoying the mountains around.
